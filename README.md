# streamlit-BIGG-metabolic-analyzer-API
- streamlit application as API to analyze the [BIGG Metabolic models](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/)
- You can have the reactions, gene sequences
- You can have the models and the reactions.
- I implemented faster iteration and hash searching to make it faster and not implemented the page rank or the stack algorithm.
